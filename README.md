# fia-doc

PDF parsers to extract structured data from FIA F1 documents. This is part of theOehrly/Fast-F1#445.

We plan to get the following data from the PDFs:

* lap times: for each race/sprint, the lap times of each driver in each lap
* tyre compounds: for each race, the mapping from "Soft", "Medium", "Hard" to the actual tyre compounds C1, C2, etc.
* penalties: in progress
